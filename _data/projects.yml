  description: With the development of Information and Communication Technologies and the dissemination of smartphones, especially now that image search is possible through the internet, e-commerce markets are more activating purchasing services for a wide variety of products. However, it often happens that the image of the desired product is impaired and that the search engine does not recognize it properly. The idea of this study is to help search for products through image restoration using an image pre-processing and image inpainting algorithm for damaged images. It helps users easily purchase the items they want by providing a more accurate image search system. Besides, the system has the advantage of efficiently showing information by category, so that enables efficient sales of registered information.

  description: Recently, K-POP based on dance music has been attracting worldwide attention. Since such dance music is produced as "pre-composed, post-choreography," it does not guarantee the choreographers' complete freedom of creation. On the other hand, modern dancers decide on a dance program first to express various artistry and then set up background music accordingly. Since it is important to emphasize the details of the movement at every moment, they usually leave the composition to get the best song for dance. However, this production process is difficult to discuss, and it consumes a lot of time and money when producing new songs every time. In order to help such a situation, the technology to automatically compose music from the choreography is needed.
